# Updating a user's status
{: #status}

A user's assigned status depends on if the user accepted their invitation to join the account, they're a VPN-only user, or if the user adminstrator set the user as a disabled classic infrastructure user.
{:shortdesc}

If you have the following access, you can update the status of another user:

  * An IAM policy with Editor or higher role on the User management service.
  * You are an ancestor in the classic infrastructure hierarchy for the user and you have the Manage users classic infrastructure permission assigned

For more information about the types of user status, see [User states](/docs/iam/userstatus.html#status).

## Options for changing a user's status

You can choose from the following options to update a user's state:

<dl>
<dt>Active</dt>
<dd>The user has full access to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console based on their assigned access policies and classic infrastructure permissions.</dd>
<dt>Disabled classic infrastructure</dt>
<dd>The user can no longer access classic infrastructure resources, but can continue to log in to the console and access platform resources.</dd>
<dt>VPN-only</dt>
<dd>The user can't log in to the console, but they do have access to whatever devices and VPN subnets that you assign for classic infrastructure by logging in directly to the appliance.</dd>
</dl>

When you update a user from from VPN-only status to Active status, the user must know the password to log in to the console. In most cases, this is the SoftLayer ID password, which might need to be reset to be used. In rare cases where the user already has an IBMid, they must log in with the IBMid and password.

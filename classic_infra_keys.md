# Managing classic infrastructure API keys
{: #classic_keys}

You can use classic infrastructure API keys to access classic infrastructure APIs. You can have only one classic infrastructure API key per user. The user whose account the API key is for can create, delete, and view the details for the API key. If you are an ancestor in the classic infrastructure hierarchy for a user, and you have the Manage users classic infrastructure permission assigned, you can view, create, and delete classic infrastructure API keys for VPN only users.

To manage your classic infrastructure API keys, go to **Manage** > **Access (IAM)**, and select **Users**. Click a users's name, and then click **User details**.

  * To create a classic infrastructure API key, click **Add a classic infrastructure key** in the API keys section.

     Copy or download the API key, and save it in a safe place. You can retrieve the details of the API key later by using the **View details** option from the **Actions** ![List of actions icon](../icons/action-menu-icon.svg) menu.

     When you create a classic infrastructure API key, you are enabled to use the IP address restrictions feature on the **User details** page.
     {: tip}

  * To delete a classic infrastructure API key, select **Delete** from the **Actions** ![List of actions icon](../icons/action-menu-icon.svg) menu on the row for the API key in the API keys section.

# Ordering external authentication MFA for a user
{: #external}

As an administrator with the correct access, you can order external authentication and enable the multi-factor authentication (MFA) option for a user's login. You are charged a monthly fee for the external authentication options. This type of multifactor authentication (MFA) is required only for the account where the setting is enabled unlike ID-based MFA. For more information, see [Types of multifactor authentication](/docs/iam/mfatypes.html#types).

## Ordering external authentication
{: #ordering}

If you have any the following access, you can order external authentication for a user: 

* Editor or higher role on the User management service
* You are an ancestor in the classic infrastructure hierarchy for the user and you have the Manage users classic infrastructure permission assigned

To order external authentication, complete the following steps:

1. From the menu bar, click **Manage** &gt; **Access (IAM)**, and select **Users**. 
2. Select a user from the list.
3. From the **User details** page in the **Manage user's login** section, select **Order external authentication**.
4. Select **Symantec identity protection** or **Phone-based identity protection**.
    * For Symantec authentication, the user must download the [Symantec VIP](https://vip.symantec.com/){: new_window} ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg) app and obtain a credential ID to continue with the ordering process.
    * For phone-based authentication, you can proceed with the order, but your user must [set up their configuration](/docs/account/login_settings.html#third-party-MFA) before you can enable the option.
5. Based on your selection, follow the prompts to review the price and terms before you place the order.
6. Click **Order** to finalize your selection.

After Symantec authentication is ordered, you can turn on the option for the user from the User details page. And, after phone-based authentication is ordered and then configured by the user, you can turn on the option for the user from the User details page. 

## Disabling external authentication options
{: #disable}

You can disable Symantec or phone-based MFA for a user at any time. 

1. From the menu bar, click **Manage** &gt; **Access (IAM)**, and select **Users**.
2. Select a user from the list.
3. From the **User details** page in the **Manage user's login** section, set the **Symantec authentication** or **Phone-based authentication** option to off.

## Cancelling external authentication options
{: #cancel}

You can cancel your order for external authentication at any time, if you have the correct access. You can choose to cancel immediately without any refund, or you can choose to cancel it at the one year mark from when you ordered it.

* Manage users classic infrastructure permission
* Cancel services classic infrastructure permission
* Administrator for the Support Center account management service or the view, edit, and add ticket migrated classic infrastructure permissions that are not available within the [migrated permission access groups](/docs/iam/infrastructureaccess.html#predefined).

3. From the **User details** page in the **Manage user's login** section, click **Delete** ![Delete icon](../icons/icon_trash.svg) for the **Symantec authentication** or **Phone-based authentication** row depending on which one you ordered.
4. Select when to remove it.

# Setting user view access
{: #userlistview}

As an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} account owner, you can view all users in your account and define how users can view other users in the account. 
{:shortdesc}

When the **Unrestricted view** option is selected, any user in the account can view other users from the Users page in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console. When the **Restricted view** option is selected, users are restricted to viewing only the users in the account that they invited, share a Cloud Foundry org with, or users who are their descendants in the classic infrastructure user hierarchy, meaning the users that they invited or that one of their descendants invited.

By default, the unrestricted view is set for your account. To update this setting, complete the following steps:

1. From the menu bar, click **Manage** &gt; **Access (IAM)**, and select **Settings**.
2. Select **Restricted view** for the **User list visibility** setting.

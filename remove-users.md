# Removing users
{: #remove}

When you remove a user from the account, the user can no longer log in to the console, switch to your account if they still belong to another account, or access account resources.
{:shortdesc}

Only account owners or users with the following access can remove users from an account:

* An IAM policy for the User management account management service with the Administrator role assigned and be the Cloud Foundry org manager if the user belongs to a Cloud Foundry org.
* If you have classic infrastructure in your account, then a user must have an IAM policy for the User management account management service with the Administrator role assigned, be the Cloud Foundry org manager if the user belongs to a Cloud Foundry org, and be an ancestor of the user in the classic infrastructure user hierarchy with the Manage user classic infrastructure permission assigned.

To remove a user from an account, complete the following steps:

1. From the menu bar, click **Manage** &gt; **Access (IAM)**, and select **Users**.
2. From the row of the user that you want to remove, select **Remove user** from the **Actions** ![List of actions icon](../icons/action-menu-icon.svg) menu.
